The documentation system
================================================

There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good software documentation: there isn’t one
thing called *documentation*, there are four.

They are: *tutorials*, *how-to guides*, *technical reference* and *explanation*. They represent four different
purposes or functions, and require four different approaches to their creation. Understanding the implications of
this will help improve most documentation - often immensely.


About the system

The documentation system outlined here is a simple, comprehensive and nearly universally-applicable scheme. It
is proven in practice across a wide variety of fields and applications.

There are some very simple principles that govern documentation that are very rarely if ever spelled out. They seem
to be a secret, though they shouldn’t be.

If you can put these principles into practice, **it will make your documentation better and your project, product
or team more successful** - that’s a promise.
